(Police officers leave the hosiptal room)

Alex has always been a big believer that police officers don&#39;t do much. So they decided to take matters into their own hands and try to figure out this mystery on their own. 

What is Alex&#39;s first step?

[[Remeber the details of assualt to match clues to the killer]]

Javier&#39;s body was discovered 6 days later by hikers. Police ruled his death as an overdosed and his case was never opened again.

JAVIER!!

It all makes sense to Alex now.

But what could have Alex have done to make Javier this mad for him to attempt murder?

Now it was all a race,  Javier in no time would kill him. He is Alex&#39;s bestfriend after all. He knows where he lives.

[[What Happened]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="35" name="Visit the shop" tags="" position="600,900" size="100,100">Alex visits the shop. It is a halloween store, but filled with antique items. The place looks rusty and old. Very creepy for Alex&#39;s liking. But nonetheless, they walk to the store clerk.

Alex see&#39;s the mask of their attempted murderer at the corner of their eye. He immediatly points to the mask and asks the store clerk.

Alex:&quot;Hey do you know anything about this mask&quot;
Store Clerk:&quot;Yes, it&#39;s handmade. The shards are made from holographic material. They run about $150. You intrested?&quot;
Alex:&quot;Actually, I have a question. Can I have the history of who has bought this mask?&quot;
Store Clerk:&quot; Well, only two people have bought this mask. But one has bought this from credit card transactions so I can look up their name. But sadly, the other person who bought this mask not so long ago used cash. But I do remember how they look like.&quot;
Alex:&quot; Can I have the name of the person and a detailed description of the person who bought this recently.&quot;
Store Clerk:&quot;Yeah, Erick Johnson...and the indivdual was weird. Short guy, I&#39;d say about 5&#39;6-5&#39;7, scruff beard. Oh, and blonde hair.&quot;

Alex: Thank you so much.

Alex exits the store.
