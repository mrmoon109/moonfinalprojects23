**You and Me: A Horror Story**

*Chapter One*

You fell asleep in class, drool forming a mini-lake on your desk.

The last thing you remember is something about binomials before a wad of paper hits you on the head.

You look up, a choice expletive at the ready when any possible word dies in your mouth.

Where your teacher&#39;s face should be is just a smooth expanse of pale corpse-like flesh.

[[Scream]] \
[[Keep it together]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Scream" tags="" position="712.5,450" size="100,100">$emotional: $emotional + 1

You can&#39;t help it. A scream tears its way out of your body, out of your mouth. Thirty heads swing around to look at you.

Your eyes snap around the room at the faces around you. Their expressions range from bemused to mocking to worry. You look at the teacher again, and his warm brown eyes peer at you with concern.

He calls you by name. &quot;Are you ok?&quot;

**What is your name, anyway?**

{text input for: &#39;$yourName&#39;}

[[You stammer a response]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Keep it together" tags="" position="837.5,450" size="100,100">$stoic: $stoic + 1
--
&quot;Ohmygodohmygodohmygod,&quot; your brain screams.

But somehow, improbably, you keep it together. Your hands tighten on the sides of your desk.

&quot;Uh... you ok? It was just paper ball,&quot; you hear a voice next to you say. You hear them calling your name.

**What is your name, anyway?**

{text input for: &#39;$yourName&#39;}

You nod and stumble out of the door... you nearly run back inside.

The halls seem to be coated in a tar-like substance, resembling veins. And as you stare, you see them throb, seemingly in time with your own escalating pulse.

Your vision blurs, and the hallway seems to rotate so that you&#39;re standing on the ceiling.

A sound halfway between sickness and terror rises from your throat, and with it, vomit.

You vomit up? down? you&#39;re not sure which way, though thankfully, most of it manages to miss you except for the chunk of brown that lands on your shoe.

[if $emotional &gt; $stoic]
You scream out in frustration, kicking your foot so that the oily brown vomit on your shoe is flung to the wall.
[if $stoic &gt; $emotional]
You try to ignore the stain the vomit leaves on your shoe as you firmly shake it off.
[continue]
A head pokes out from the classroom. It&#39;s Mark. A friend.

&quot;Hey {$yourName} - you ok?&quot;

[if $gender === &quot;male&quot;]
Mark looks inside and says, &quot;I&#39;m going to check on him.&quot;

Mark looks inside and says, &quot;I&#39;m going to check on her.&quot;

[[&quot;No, no, Mark, it&#39;s fine. I&#39;m ok. Thanks for being concerned, though!&quot;]] \

A sound halfway between sickness and terror rises from your throat, and with it, vomit.

But you force it back down. You. Refuse. To. Vomit. You take a shuddering breath.

[if $stoic &gt; $emotional]
You take one more breath, and then you&#39;re ok. You will be ok.

A head pokes out from the classroom. It&#39;s Mark. A friend.

&quot;Hey {$yourName} - you ok?&quot;

You smile brightly, hoping to fool your friend that everything is ok.

Mark pauses as if to come out despite your words, but he pauses and looks you over.

&quot;Ooook,&quot; he says, his voice tinged with doubt. &quot;Call me, though, if you need anything.&quot;

You smile again and nod, a moment of warmth amidst the terro....

The hallway looks normal. No pulsating tendrils. Everything is right side up.

There&#39;s Room 334, your classroom, to your right.

Maybe all you really needed was a drink, you think to yourself.

&quot;Ok then,&quot; Mark says, frowning a little. A pause. &quot;I&#39;m just worried about you.&quot;

You make a noise that you hope sounds reassuring.

Mark looks like he wants to say more, but he shrugs and heads back into class.

You take a deep breath, willing your eyes to look at the hallway again, and....

You hear the clink of weights and grunts of students echoing out of the weight room, but you turn right in the other direction.

You begin to think you&#39;re recovering when the hallway begins to stretch ahead of you, as if some invisible omnipotent hand were pulling the floor from the opposite end.

Like putty, the floor stretches out until it snaps with an audible crack and a literal chasm appears in front of you. Veins of black begin snaking their way down the walls, across the ceiling, and over the floor.

You take a tentative step toward the break in the floor and peer down.

And you see Yourself peering up at you from the second floor, Your head twisted around so that your other You&#39;s chin rests between Your, its shoulder blades. You grin up at yourself, revealing missing teeth and swollen gums.

You, the real you, stagger back. The hall at the far end seems to be unaffected by the black veins while the clinking of weights behind you seem to be *approaching* you, but you dare not look behind.

You have to keep on going. But how?

You hold in a scream. Reaching the top of the stairs just as you reach the corner is... Yourself.

He is the exact replica of you, down to the clothes that he wears. He, You, flashes you a smile, but it doesn&#39;t reach his eyes. There is a coldness, a deadness in those eyes.

Before you can second guess your decision, you take a few steps back and your sneakers pount on the floor as you approach the chasm.

Muscles tensing, you leap across.

And your eyes flick downward.

And you see Yourself, in the same position, except for its eyes that track your movement and the grin that splits its face even further to grotseque proportions.

Your eyes snap back up as you land on the other end, and you waste no time in dashing toward the normal part of the hall.

&quot;Excuse me,&quot; you hear, the voice arresting your movement. &quot;What on Earth do you think you&#39;re doing?&quot;

You spin around and see a Taft security guard marching down the hall... the absolutely normal, boring, third-floor hall.

&quot;I said,&quot; she repeats, &quot;what are you doing, leaping around like a frog?&quot;

You mentally calculate the width of the chasm and shake your head. Nope. No way. Uh uh.

Heart racing, you spy a small shelf of flooring still in tact, about a foot wide. You weigh your options and decide that that has to be the safer option.

&quot;One foot in front of the other {$yourName},&quot; you say to yourself. &quot;Don&#39;t look down. Don&#39;t look...&quot;

And your eyes flick downward.

And you see Yourself, in the same position, except for its eyes that track your movement and the grin that splits its face even further to grotseque proportions.

You pick up your pace, quickly traversing the remaining distance, safely to the other side.

You&#39;ve always had with words, and you say in your most charming voice, &quot;Oh sorry, ma&#39;am. My gym teacher sent me out here to get more practice.&quot;

You hope she can&#39;t hear the pounding of your heart, visions of Yourself still haunting your memory.

She gives you a doubting look, but then shrugs and says, &quot;Ok then... just... calm down a bit? You seemed really... scared.&quot;

The concern on her face twinges your heart momentarily with guilt, but you just smile back.

&quot;Of course, I&#39;m so sorry for disturbing you!&quot; you reply, as you turn and make your way in the direction you were heading.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; you mutter, refusing to make eye contact.

She waits, expecting you to say more, to offer some sort of explanation. You shrug, and begin turning, not wanting to lie to her. You were brought up better than that.

&quot;I&#39;m just getting some water,&quot; you say over your shoulder. It&#39;s not a lie. Your teacher did tell you to do just that.

You hear a sigh, but nothing else as the security guard hopefully heads in the other direction.

A smile fills your face, though you&#39;re sure it looks insincere, filling you with not a small amount of guilt.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; you say. &quot;I thought...&quot;

You can&#39;t tell her what you saw... what you&#39;re seeing... but you don&#39;t want to lie to her. You were brought up better than that.

&quot;I got startled,&quot; you say, settling on the partial truth. Your cheeks flush a little. &quot;Sorry again!&quot;

The security guard nods and smiles sympathetically. &quot;Of course,&quot; she says. &quot;You did look a little scared there. You sure you&#39;re ok?&quot;

You nod and smile again. &quot;Yes ma&#39;am. I&#39;ll just be going now.&quot;

Before she can drag you into an awkward conversation, you slowly turn and begin walking the way you were originally headed.

You reach into your pocket and pull out your Chick-fil-A receipt from two weeks ago that you&#39;ve kept for this purpose.

&quot;I got my tardy pass,&quot; you say, over your shoulder. &quot;I&#39;m going to class.&quot;

You hear the security guard huff, and you&#39;re pretty sure she&#39;s going to ask to see it, but before she can, you begin walking quickly away, shoving the receipt back into your pocket.

[[Head toward the second floor stairs]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="20" name="Head toward the second floor stairs" tags="" position="775,1500" size="100,100">You decide that getting out of the building would be a good idea and so you head toward the stairs heading downstairs... except, the stairs going down aren&#39;t there.

Instead, the stairs head straight up, ending at the ceiling. There is no way down.

You gulp, and look down the hallway. You can always try the next set of stairs, you think to yourself, and your head begins to throb. You close your eyes, pinching the bridge of your nose as the headache radiates outward like an exploding star.

And you reopen your eyes to see the black tendrils falling from the ceiling, its bulbous veins swelling and contracting with the pulse in your head. A thick mist seems to swirl around you, the moist air slightly bitter.

&quot;{$yourName},&quot; Mr. Grishaber&#39;s voice says. You groan. This is the last thing you need right now.

&quot;Hi Mr. G,&quot; you respond weakly.

&quot;{$yourName},&quot; he repeats, &quot;I hope you&#39;re continuing to SOAR today!&quot; His cheerfulness grates on your nerve, but as your eyes focus on him, the air seems to ripple around him, spreading outward and...

... the black tendrils vanish. Your headache, too, seems to fade into the background.

&quot;Are you ok?&quot; he says, taking a closer look at you. &quot;Do you need to go to the nurse? Do you want me to call home?&quot;

The sheer wrongness of the You staring at you overwhelms you with disgust, and before you realize what you&#39;re doing, you find yourself shoving Yourself down the stairs.

When your hands make contact with Your chest, a slimy film seems to spread up your arms. Revolted, you yank your hands back as your twin tumbles backward.

His face doesn&#39;t betray a flicker of surprise or fear. In fact, his dead eyes just watch yours as he tumbles backward. His head bounces against the stairs, and despite yourself, you cringe in sympathy, but he doesn&#39;t seem fazed.

&quot;And I was in math class and the teacher was going on and on about binomials,&quot; you continue, getting into the act, &quot;and I raised my hand to ask, &#39;What do you do with a mathematician who only uses binomials?&#39;&quot;

&quot;You should have seen his face, {$bestFriend},&quot; you continue. &quot;He was so confused. So I answered my own question, &#39;You FOIL his plans!&#39;&quot;

Despite themselves, the corner of {$bestFriend}&#39;s mouth quirks up.

&quot;His face then turned beet red, and he told me to get out of his classroom. Just as I had planned!&quot; you say, rubbing your hands together like a mad scientist. &quot;And as I was on my way down to see you, I ran into a security guard,&quot; you smack your fists together. &quot;You should have seen the look on her face...&quot;

You momentarily trail off, your memory involuntarily flicking back to the melting face that started this whole episode.

{$bestFriend} notices your distraction. &quot;{$yourName}?&quot;

&quot;Huh? What? Oh right,&quot; you say, and launch into the rest of your story.

Your friend pulls out their phone. &quot;Class is about to end,&quot; they say, &quot;and I, unlike you, am not trying to get in trouble. But... why did you just wait for me outside the door?&quot;

Your puzzled expression is answer enough.

&quot;When you stopped outside my seventh period and waved at me to come out,&quot; they say. &quot;Why didn&#39;t you wait for me then?&quot;

The words and laughter die in your mouth. &quot;When I...&quot; Your face pales. &quot;Oh right. Yeah, when I stopped by... I really had to go pee. Sorry about that!&quot;

{$bestFriend} folds their arms, unimpressed.

&quot;Anyway,&quot; you say, putting on your smooth facade, &quot;you should probably get back to class... I need to see about something.&quot;

You look down the second floor hall.

&quot;I just needed some water,&quot; you answer truthfully, before pivoting. &quot;Did you hear about the fight second period?&quot;

He rolls his eyes. &quot;I&#39;m so tired of high school,&quot; {$bestFriend} responds.

&quot;I know, right?&quot; you say, eager to continue this conversation. Both of you have talked at length about looking forward to college. Both of you are going to the same out-of-state university, and though you&#39;re studying different things, you&#39;re looking forward to the change of pace.

Especially now, you think to yourself.

&quot;What do you think the food is like in college?&quot;

&quot;Whatever it is, it&#39;s gotta be better than black bean spaghetti,&quot; you retort, mouth curling in disgust at the memories.

{$bestFriend} shudders. &quot;I think I lived on vending machine food for my entire junior year,&quot; he says. &quot;If I never have to eat another bag of baked chips, I&#39;ll be good.&quot;

You laugh, glad for the distraction, but guilt gnaws at you that, even as you go back and forth, you notice a look in {$bestFriend}&#39;s eyes that shows you haven&#39;t completely fooled him.

He looks at you, nodding for you to continue.

**Chapter Two: The Great I Am**

You make your way down the hall, resolve growing with every step. You need to put an end to this.

Armed with this determination, you round the corner when the bell rings ending seventh period. Doors slam open as the horde that is the Taft student body boil out into the halls. And...

You stagger.

Every fourth or fifth person in the growing crowd is faceless - it looks a little like melted wax, a maggoty white color. As one, their heads snap to look at you, and though there are no features to break up the smooth expanse of skin, you swear they&#39;re grinning.

A student (one with a face, you note) bumps into you as he passes by, awakening you from your frightened reverie. You shake your head, hoping to clear it and return to the normal hall as it has in the past.

But the nightmare vision persists. And as you watch, one girl, pleated short skirt and raven hair done in braids, reaches out to tap a boy on his shoulder. He turns, seemingly undisturbed by the faceless monstrosity. She gives him a peck on the cheek, and the boy&#39;s face melts before you eyes, dissolving into the featureless skin.

This scene is repeated all down the hall. Quick kisses, light and brief. Melted faces. It&#39;s like a perverse game of tag.

You look around in growing horror and see a student, who still has their face. A sophomore you think. You grab them by the shoulders and shake them.

&quot;Wh...&quot; they splutter, taking an earbud from one ear. &quot;What&#39;s wrong with you?&quot;

You sweep your arms around the hall. &quot;Do you not see any of this?&quot;

They blink once, their hazel eyes filled with confusion. &quot;What are you...&quot;

And then you watch as realization seems to dawn on them. &quot;What in the world?!&quot; Their eyes widen and swing wildly toward the wall, putting your body in between them and the hallway filled with Faceless.

&quot;You need to get out of here. Warn whoever you can,&quot; you saw. They wince as you squeeze their arm harder than you had intended. &quot;Get out of here before... before you become one of them.&quot;

They nod, tightening the straps on their backpack and putting their earbud back in. A look of fearful determination sharpens their face as they begin making their way to the stairs.

You saved one student. Great. Now what?

They look around, and then back at you, anger creasing their brow. &quot;What is wrong with you?&quot; They wrench their shoulders from your grasp. &quot;Keep your hands off me, freak!&quot;

That last word seems to echo down the hall.

&quot;Freak.&quot; The word is repeated, as down a chain, by all the faceless in a flat, emotionless voice. &quot;Freak. Freak. Freak. Freak. Freak.&quot;

You clamp your hands over your ears and begin sprinting down the hallway. But to where?

You look around in growing horror and see a student missing their face. A junior, you think. You grab them by the shoulders and shake them.

You expected some sort of reaction. Anger. Surprise.  Instead, it just &quot;looks&quot; at you. And then its dark brown arms lift slowly, its color in stark contrast to the colorless face.

Hypnotized by the movement, you don&#39;t move until its hands nearly reach your face. You jerk away, using your backpack to knock its arms away.

Instead of retaliating, it grabs a passing student, a girl with dyed pink hair, transforming her into a faceless student. As the gut-churning transformation finishes, both the original student you shook and the pink haired girl turn to stare at you, taunting you.

You storm away, knowing you can&#39;t do anything here.

Hypnotized by the movement, you fail to move as his hands land on your face. They begin to draw you closer, but even this initial contact sends oily rivulets of wrongness coursing through your face.

You finally shove them off, and you feel the wrongness course through your face.

&quot;NO.&quot; You grit your teeth. You shake your head. &quot;NO.&quot;

The feeling leaves your face, but you watch in horror as the veins in your left arm enlarge and blacken. You watch it pulse with your heartbeat. No amount of shaking, scratching, or even denying changes the fact. Your arm is... infected.

You don&#39;t want to attract any more attention, even as the faceless students seem to watch your every moment. You lower your head and begin the delicate dance of moving down an overcrowded hallway without bumping into anyone.

Thankfully, you have a lot of experience from your three years at Taft, your moves almost a dance as you dodge and weave. The last thing you want to do is bump into one of those... *things.*

You almost make it to the end of the hallway when you realize you don&#39;t have the faintest idea where to find Yourself. Each time, it&#39;s as if You found you.

[else]

You try not to attract any more attention and so you lower your head, planning on moving as stealthily as possible down the hall.

It&#39;s going well until your backpack clips a student, who spins around toward you, swearing. And this seems to spark a chain reaction: all the faceless students and many of the normal ones simultaneously turn in almost choreographed precision.

As one, they say, &quot;Watch where you&#39;re going, idiot!&quot; their voices all in their natural pitches but somehow lifeless. You notice a few more faces melt away, joining the growing mass.

The black veins crawl across the walls and floors, and as a hand lands on your shoulder, you start as an oily presence seems to slide toward you. You jerk away, not even bothering to look who it was, and push your way through the hall.

But to where?

An aggrieved chorus of &quot;Hey watch it!&quot; and &quot;What the f--, bro?&quot; rises up as you shoulder your way through the crowd. You try to avoid making contact with any of the faceless, but occasionally, you clip one.

Each time, an oily sensation spreads up your body at the point of contact, but each time, you grit your teeth and shake it off with a spike of anger.

You nearly bowl over a small sophomore girl, who staggers backward in your path. You reach out to grab her by the hand.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; you say, distracted, before continuing your march to find Yourself.

[else]

You begin pushing your way through the hall, but a couple of students who might as well be linebackers on the football team stand in your way. One is faceless and the other is not, but they form a solid wall.

Grimacing, you put your head down, intending to split them, but it&#39;s as if you hit brick. You literally bounce and fall backward on your butt and hands.

They high five each other, and the moment their hands make contact, the big, blonde student who had a face no longer has one. You watch as it dissolves, one blue eye remaining just a second longer, and you swear it looks panicked before it, too, dissolves.

You scramble backward, earning a few more curses and dark looks before you get back on your feet and dodge your way down the hall.

Tapping your foot, you lean against the wall opposite Ms. Katzmarek&#39;s class, hoping to see You arriving to class.

For a moment, you question your logic on why your twin would even go to class, when the bell rings. Nothing. The halls are still crowded with both faceless and normal students, taking their sweet time in getting to class, but you don&#39;t see Yourself.

Ms. Katzmarek closes her door, and you begin pacing. Out of the corner of your eye, you see through the window at your seat by the door, and...

You see Yourself raising Your hand, responding to a question that the teacher had asked. Several classmates laugh in response, some normal and others faceless. A shiver travels up your spine, hearing laughter emanate from the blank skin where their mouths should be.

Seventh period lunch traffic still clogs the hall, and so you stand off to the side, keeping your eyes peeled.

Every third person now, it seems, has lost their face, a scene straight from a nightmare. As each faceless student passes, each tilts their head in your direction as if regarding you. But otherwise, they seem to ignore you, not attempting to touch you as they do with other students.

Your head pounds, making your vision blur, even as the black veins grow from the walls, ceiling, and floor, reaching toward you, it seems.

Colors, sounds, noise, noise and more noise pass by you, and you&#39;re beginning to regret your decision to come here. A student with a face bumps into you, a look of annoyance on his face rather than apology.

And in the midst of this chaos, you spot a flash of color. The same flash of color that you sport on your shoes, but you lose it again the swirling mass of humanity.

You don&#39;t want to get Miss K involved, so you step to the side, out of her line of sight. You catch the Other You&#39;s eyes, which isn&#39;t difficult as those dead eyes seem to be aware of your every moment.

His mouth spreads wide, wider than it should, revealing missing teeth and the black tendrils dangling from the roof of his mouth. &quot;Now leave me alone.

You barely contain lashing out. &quot;You&#39;re not me,&quot; you hiss through gritted teeth. &quot;How are you even possible? What is going on?&quot; Your questions tumble out.

Though your conversation was quiet enough that it should have been impossible to hear through the closed door, the faceless ones in the class turn simultaneously toward you and say in an unneverving monotone voice &quot;Imposter.&quot;

Turning the knob and pushing the door open at the same time (thanking your luck that the door wasn&#39;t locked... that would have been embarrassing), you barge into the class.

The class turns toward you, a few gasping in surprise. You notice with discomfort that a few more students have gone faceless.

&quot;Daaaaaaamn,&quot; one boy says. &quot;How did you get from your seat to the hallway so quickly, {$yourName}?&quot;

Your forward momentum freezes. You look at your seat. The Other You is still there, now staring at you with an eyebrow quirked.

Regaining your confidence, you point. &quot;You don&#39;t see that?&quot; you demand.

&quot;Your seat?&quot; the same boy responds, attitude coloring his voice now.

All the faceless students shake their head in unison with the other You.

The other You straightens up, apparently interested.

You hear laughter burst out from the room.

Rubbing your head, you peer through the window. The Other You is still there, a mechanical laughter emitting from its mouth, while the eyes stare at you with no hint of humor.

Miss K stalks over, pushing the door open and narrowly avoiding hitting you.

&quot;Can I talk to you in the hall?&quot; you ask Miss K, voice lowered. She nods, following you back into the hallway, but not before glancing back at the Other You. You see her shiver.

Before you can begin, she interjects. &quot;What is going on? And who,&quot; she says, subtly motioning toward your seat, &quot;is that?&quot;

*Well,* you think to yourself, *at least she doesn&#39;t think that thing is the real you.*

[if _success]
&quot;It&#39;s not me,&quot; you say. And you begin, as best as you&#39;re able, to explain the events of the day.

After a long pause, Miss K responds. &quot;And you&#39;re saying that there are several faceless students in there?&quot;

[if _success &amp;&amp; $gender === &#39;male&#39;]
You nod, and begin listing off their names. As you do, you see You turn around and begin talking to a classmate, who until now had kept her face. You shiver as you watch her eyes, nose, and mouth slide downward and seemingly disappear under her chin.

&quot;And Kristin, too.&quot;

He, *It* you forcefully say to yourself, turns toward you and Miss K, waggling his fingers.

&quot;You need to get them out of there, Miss K,&quot; you plead. &quot;Away from that... thing.&quot;

She nods resolutely. &quot;Alright. I&#39;ll do it,&quot; she says.

You&#39;re almost taken aback on how readily your teacher agrees, but then again, she can see the wrongness in the Other You. Every time she looks in that direction, she shivers.

Without another word, she marches back into class and tells everyone to stand up and follow her outside. &quot;Everyone except {$yourName},&quot; you hear her say.

No one bats an eye (at least, those who still have eyes) at you seemingly existing in two places at once.

They, both the faceless students and the unaffected, follow Miss K as she leads them down the hall toward the stairs.

As they pass, though, each of the faceless turns to you and whispers a &quot;Thanks,&quot; their invisible tongues drawing out the &quot;s&quot; sound.

[[You walk in, ready to confront the Other You]] \
[[You pause, considering how to deal with the Other You]]

[if !_success]
&quot;Whatever you need to say, you can say it right here,&quot; Miss K declares, a look of mistrust filling her eyes as they flick between yours and Yours.

You start to protest, but notice the look in Miss K&#39;s eyes.

&quot;Ok,&quot; you breathe. And you blurt out the whole story, fear and anger and all the hundred emotions from the last hour sharpening your voice.

At various points, laughter, mainly from the faceless ones, greets your words. Looks of discomfort, fear, and amusement war in the few faces remaining among your classmates.

&quot;And *you*?&quot; Miss K asks, pointedly look at the Other You, still seated in your desk. The other students don&#39;t seem to even blink at the fact that there are two of you.

[if !_success &amp;&amp; $gender===&#39;male&#39;]
He, *It*, lifts his shoulders in a shrug. &quot;I don&#39;t know who he is,&quot; he says, gesturing to you. &quot;I&#39;m {$firstName}, you&#39;re Miss K, and you all,&quot; he says, gesturing to the other students, &quot;are my classmates in 8th period IB World History.&quot;

His voice is so convincing, so smooth that you see Miss K and your classmates nodding. You grind your teeth together, not even surprised as you watch everyone&#39;s face, including your teacher&#39;s, begin to melt away.

&quot;You,&quot; the Other You says, looking at you with his soulless eyes, &quot;are not wanted here.&quot;

Miss K looks at you again, this time with a bloom of suspicion in her eyes. &quot;How do I know...&quot; She swallows, looking at the Other You again and shivering. &quot;How do I know which one is the real you?&quot;

The Other You stops laughing and points a finger in your direction. &quot;Clearly this is the imposter!&quot;

Everyone, faceless and normal students alike, nods. In horror, you see Miss K nod.

And on their final nod, a sharp, convulsive jerk, their faces seem to slide off, leaving behind that eerily empty stretch of skin.

You hear the Other You speak, ice in every word.

The Other You stands and casually walks out of the classroom, as Miss K and and the class echo in chorus, &quot;Imposter, imposter, imposter...&quot;

&quot;Can I talk to you in the hall?&quot; you ask Miss K, voice lowered. She&#39;s about to say no, judging from the expression on her face, and you tense.

Your teacher relents, though, and steps out in the hall with you.

&quot;What is it?&quot; she says, her voice short. 

[if _success]
&quot;It&#39;s not me,&quot; you say. And you begin, as best as you&#39;re able, to explain the events of the day.

After a long pause, Miss K responds. &quot;And you&#39;re saying that there are several faceless students in there?&quot;

[if _success &amp;&amp; $gender === &#39;male&#39;]
You nod, and begin listing off their names. As you do, you see You turn around and begin talking to a classmate, who until now had kept her face. You shiver as you watch her eyes, nose, and mouth slide downward and seemingly disappear under her chin.

&quot;And Kristin, too.&quot;

He, *It* you forcefully say to yourself, turns toward you and Miss K, waggling his fingers.

[if _success]
&quot;You need to get them out of there, Miss K,&quot; you plead. &quot;Away from that... thing.&quot;

She nods resolutely. &quot;Alright. I&#39;ll do it,&quot; she says.

You&#39;re almost taken aback on how readily your teacher agrees, but then again, she can see the wrongness in the Other You. Every time she looks in that direction, she shivers.

Without another word, she marches back into class and tells everyone to stand up and follow her outside. &quot;Everyone except {$yourName},&quot; you hear her say.

No one bats an eye (at least, those who still have eyes) at you seemingly existing in two places at once.

They, both the faceless students and the unaffected, follow Miss K as she leads them down the hall toward the stairs.

As they pass, though, each of the faceless turns to you and whispers a &quot;Thanks,&quot; their invisible tongues drawing out the &quot;s&quot; sound.

[[You walk in, ready to confront the Other You]] \
[[You pause, considering how to deal with the Other You]]

[if !_success]
&quot;Whatever you need to say, you can say it right here,&quot; Miss K declares, looking at you with growing suspicion and hostility.

You start to protest, but notice that look.

&quot;Ok,&quot; you breathe. And you blurt out the whole story, fear and anger and all the hundred emotions from the last hour sharpening your voice.

At various points, laughter, mainly from the faceless ones, greets your words. Looks of discomfort, fear, and amusement war in the few faces remaining among your classmates.

No one seems to even blink at the fact that there are two of you.

[if !_success &amp;&amp; $gender===&#39;male&#39;]
He, *It*, lifts his shoulders in a shrug. &quot;I don&#39;t know who he is,&quot; he says, gesturing to you. &quot;I&#39;m {$firstName}, you&#39;re Miss K, and you all,&quot; he says, gesturing to the other students, &quot;are my classmates in 8th period IB World History.&quot;

His voice is so convincing, so smooth that you see Miss K and your classmates nodding. You grind your teeth together, not even surprised as you watch everyone&#39;s face, including your teacher&#39;s, begin to melt away.

&quot;You,&quot; the Other You says, looking at you with his soulless eyes, &quot;are not wanted here.&quot;

&quot;Not wanted here,&quot; everyone repeats.

You dash in, hands raised to shove You in the chest. And you swear, just for a brief, glorious moment, you saw a look of surprise cross Your face.

Your hands connect and the Other You tumbles out of the chair.

[if _success &amp;&amp; $gender===&#39;male&#39;]
He picks himself up, dusting imaginary dust from his pants. &quot;Now that,&quot; he says, voice neutral, &quot;was rude.&quot;

The Other You reaches for you, black veins showing through the skin of his arms as they seem to elongate. Your head begins pounding again, but you forcefully bat away his hands just as they curl toward you.

Again, that look of surprise.

Instead, he sighs, *so dramatically, you think to yourself*, and begins walking out of the room. &quot;I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re trying to interrupt **my** life. I&#39;m {$yourName} and you...&quot; he looks at you over his shoulder. &quot;You are an imposter. I need to see my... friends.&quot;

With that, he walks out.

You dash in, but in your unusual haste, you trip, skidding across the floor on your elbows. You collapse completely to the floor and you see Your shoes.

They give you a vicious kick in the head.

Your head spins and a headache explodes from behind your eyes like a supernova, blinding in its intensity. You groan.

You hear the Other You speak, ice in every word.

&quot;I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re trying to interrupt **my** life. I&#39;m {$yourName} and you... are an imposter. I need to see my... friends.&quot; Your blood chills.

You groan again, struggling with vertigo as you get back to your feet.

As Miss K takes your class downstairs, you hesitate.

The Other You watches you, curiosity filling the otherwise dead eyes.

You don&#39;t want to trap yourself in the room with Yourself, as you can imagine any confrontation turning physical.

&quot;Come on out,&quot; you call into the room. &quot;Let&#39;s talk.&quot;

[if _success &amp;&amp; $gender===&#39;male&#39;]
With a giant sigh worthy of an Oscar, the Other You stands, and stretches luxuriously. For a moment, you find yourself admiring You, before shaking that ... weird thought from your mind.

He steps out, now standing just a few feet away from you. &quot;I&#39;m here. Now what? What do you want?&quot; he asks, annoyance seeping in.

&quot;Who are you? I mean,&quot; you stumble over your words, &quot;how are you even possible? You&#39;re not me but...&quot; You gesture.

&quot;I could ask the same of you,&quot; You replies, his dead eyes scanning your body from head to toe. His appraisal makes you shudder, like cold oil being poured down your back. &quot;I&#39;m just living my life, going to my classes and you,&quot; he says, raising an accusatory finger, &quot;interrupt me.&quot;

He suddenly strikes out, a fist arcing toward your head.

You dodge. Your body already in a heightened state of caution, you picked up on the slight dip of his shoulder before the punch came your way, and you crouch.

His punch sails harmlessly over you, and from your coiled position, you&#39;re able to lunge upwards, delivering a returning punch to his jaw.

The moment your fist connects, you feel the oily tendrils creep down your hand, and you shake your hand in disgust.

He cracks his neck and works his jaw. &quot;Ow,&quot; You says to you, his voice devoid of any emotion. &quot;I&#39;m going to see my... friends.&quot; And he walks away.

&quot;Stay away from my life,&quot; You says, as you groan. &quot;I&#39;m going to see my... friends.&quot;  He then spins on his heels and walks away.

&quot;Who are you? I mean,&quot; you stumble over your words, &quot;how are you even possible? You&#39;re not me but...&quot; You gesture.

&quot;I could ask the same of you,&quot; You replies, their dead eyes scanning your body from head to toe. Their appraisal makes you shudder, like cold oil being poured down your back. &quot;I&#39;m just living my life, going to my classes and you,&quot; they say, raising an accusatory finger, &quot;interrupt me.&quot;

They suddenly strike out, a fist arcing toward your head.

And it connects. You&#39;re not used to being in a state of readiness and waiting, and the punch knocks you off your feet. You land on the ground, that secondary impact knocking the wind from you.

The Other You crouches next to your prone body. They lift your head so that you&#39;re forced to meet their dead eyes. You feel the oily tendrils creep across your forehead and your ever present headache explodes.

The only sound from the classroom is a polite applause. You turn your head to see Miss K and all the students, faceless, clapping lightly, their hands upraised.

&quot;Stay away from my life,&quot; You says, as you groan.  &quot;I need to go see my... friends.&quot; They then spin on their heels and walks away.

Ignoring Miss K&#39;s mechanical voice telling you to leave, you stomp over to the Other You. For a moment, you swear you saw surprise cross that unnatural face.

You shove, and your hands connect and the Other You tumbles out of the chair.

He picks himself up, dusting imaginary dust from his pants. &quot;Now that,&quot; he says, voice neutral, &quot;was rude.&quot;

The Other You reaches for you, black veins showing through the skin of his arms as they seem to elongate. Your head begins pounding again, but you forcefully bat away his hands just as they curl toward you.

Again, that look of surprise.

Instead, he sighs, *so dramatically, you think to yourself*, and begins walking out of the room. &quot;I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re trying to interrupt **my** life. I&#39;m {$yourName} and you...&quot; he looks at you over his shoulder. &quot;You are an imposter.&quot;

Miss K and the other faceless ones turn to you and begin shouting that word &quot;imposter&quot; in a shrill voice. Under that chorus, the Other You looks you straight in the eye, &quot;I need to see my... friends.&quot;

You stomp over, but in your unusual haste, you trip, skidding across the floor on your elbows. You collapse completely to the floor and you see Your shoes.

They give you a vicious kick in the head.

Your head spins and a headache explodes from behind your eyes like a supernova, blinding in its intensity. You groan.

You hear the Other You speak, ice in every word.

Your sneakered feet start sprinting down the hall as you watch it round the corner to the stairs, one finger raised in farewell.

Several heads pop out of doors up and down the hallway, some teachers and some students.

&quot;What?&quot; you growl, and amazingly, no one has anything to say. Doors close again and you reset your focus down the hall.

He makes a crass comment and you fumble for a comeback, but by the time you think of one, he&#39;s already gone in one of the many classrooms down the hall.

You groan, dragging your hand down your face.

You steadily walk to the stairs in the corner and there&#39;s no sign.

But then, a flicker of movement. You&#39;d know that leg and shoe anywhere. It is, after all, *your* leg and shoe that you see just leaving your field of vision, heading down the hallway to the auditorium.

You run down the stairs, your heart pounding in your ears.

You lean over the rail as far as you dare, and you sigh in disappointment.

Maybe just a little further, you say, and though warning bells start ringing in your head. You&#39;ve leaned just far enough that your body swings you the rest of your way, and you fall several feet onto the stairs below.

A loud crack and a shooting pain in your arm tell you that your mistake is going to have some lasting consequences. Cradling your arm as best as you can so you don&#39;t pass out from the pain, you slowly pick yourself up and see your uinjured Other You walking down the hall toward the auditorium.

You break your fall with an extended arm, saving yourself from possible death, but any other thought vanishes as a loud crack echoes in the stairwell and a shooting pain lances up your arm.

Your poor decision, it seems, has just cost you your arm. Cradling your arm as best as you can to avoid passing out from the pain, you struggle to your feet to follow the Other You who is well down the hall, heading toward the auditorium.

Your vision narrows to a tunnel as he throws down his bag, attracting the attention of the few normal students. &quot;Bring it,&quot; he says, using his hands to motion you closer before clenching them into fists.

Two large students, football players by the size of them before they had turned faceless, seem to focus on you. Somehow, despite the eerie blankness of their face, you still feel eyes narrowing as they converge on your location and execute a textbook tackle.

You fall backward, and unthinking, you reach your arm backward to catch yourself, and you hear the snap before feeling the unholy pain burning up your arm. You finish your fall, two large bodies burying you and your broken arm twisted uselessly beneath your body.

And as if at a silent command, both stand up simultaneously, picking you up none so gently as the Other You approaches.

Out of control, you reach out with an arm to catch your fall, but the combined weight of you and the faceless student on your back causes your arm to buckle... in completely the wrong direction.

You scream as your arm twists at an unnatural angle on the floor, and you flail in pain. The one benefit to your sudden movement is that it finally dislodges the student from your back.

Still blinking away the tears of pain, you see Your shoes enter your field of vision. Without words, one shoe lifts and kicks you in the chest, sending you sprawling backward, and sending a fresh jolt of nauseating pain from your arm.

&quot;No,&quot; you growl, lunging toward them, but you&#39;re met with a sudden wall of faceless students, blocking your view.

A moment later, they part, seemingly resuming their individual walks to eighth period, and the Other You is nowhere to be seen.

You spin around wildly, and you think you catch sight of them skipping, *skipping* you seethe, down the stairs.

[if _success]
[[You are not getting away that easily!]]

[if !_success &amp;&amp; !$injured]
The Other You&#39;s grin widens as you step forward. Quick as lightning, You unleashes two punches, one landing in your gut, which causes you to double over and the other to the side of your head, which knocks you off your feet.

Wheezing and blinking at the dizziness that consumes you, you see Your pair of shoes enter your unsteady field of vision.

A cold voice somewhere above you says, &quot;Nice try. Now, I need to see about my... friends.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; you growl, trying to stand up, but the world spins around you again, but this time due to the punch you took to the head and not whatever happened earlier.

By the time your equilibrium returns, the Other You is nowhere to be seen.

You carefully turn in all directions, and you think you catch sight of *it* skipping down the stairs.

For a moment, your body wants to surge forward at the Other You&#39;s taunts, but you pause and take a deep breath. Outright confrontation (and honesty, if you&#39;re being honest), isn&#39;t the way you operate. You start analyzing the scene looking for a way to gain an advantage... you don&#39;t care about being fair here.

You first scan the crowd. The number of faceless is growing, and the Other You seems to be able to command them at will. Definite disadvantage. Unless...

Working on the hunch that the Other You&#39;s consciousness is tied in with *all* of the faceless, you turn around.

&quot;Running already,&quot; You calls out. &quot;Coward!&quot;

All of the faceless in hall pause, calling out &quot;Coward!&quot; and it&#39;s at that moment you begin sprinting around the hall, landing punch after punch in the guts of all the faceless students.

You wince as you punch a particularly small student who could have been your younger sibiling, but you do what you have to do. And a few students later, you hear Yourself scream out.

&quot;Stop!&quot;

You turn, sweat pouring down your face. The Other You is bent over, hands on knees.

&quot;I think it&#39;s time I pay my... friends a visit,&quot; You says, sending a chill through your body.

The faceless students converge around you, preventing you from stopping the Other You from casually walking away, showing no more ill effects of your attack.

You restrain every natural urge in your body to charge in and fight. Your eyes begin scanning the crowd, looking for anything to twist to your advantage, but the noise and confusion overwhelm you.

The moment is lost when you could have acted, and with a smirk, the Other You steps in and launches a punch to your gut, causing you to double over in pain.

By the time you recover, You is walking away, and a wall of faceless prevent you from following.

You know you stand no chance in any type of confrontation, not when your arm hangs limply at your side, pain radiating in spikes with every heartbeat. The pain is intense enough that even the thought of having a lucid conversation is questionable, especially as the edges of your vision blacken with every second.

And so you turn.

Phones whip out from both faceless and the few remaining untouched students, documenting this inglorious moment in your life. Laughter rises up, especially when the Other You calls out, &quot;Coward!&quot;

The faceless take up the call as more than two dozen phones capture your exodus as you lower your head, cradling your arm protectively close to your body. Remarkably, the faceless let you pass back through the umbilical, but the laughter and mocking ring in your ears.

You slump against the wall, and you manage to think &quot;Oh no,&quot; before you pass out.

[[You eventually wake up, right?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="61" name="You eventually wake up, right?" tags="" position="2625,900" size="100,100">You blink, completely disoriented, the unfamiliar room spinning around you.

&quot;You&#39;re up,&quot; you hear a voice say. &quot;An ambulance has been called since you passed out, and your arm is in pretty bad shape.&quot;

Your eyes manage to focus on the nurse, looking at you in concern.

&quot;I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;ve been up to,&quot; the nurse continues, &quot;but the hospital will patch you up. You may also have a concussion, so you&#39;ll probably remain hospitalized for a few days for observation.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; you croak, your mouth feeling like it swallowed a fistful of fur. &quot;I can&#39;t...&quot;

You attempt to sit up but a bout of vertigo knocks you back.

&quot;Don&#39;t move,&quot; the nurse says, iron under her kind voice.

&quot;You don&#39;t understand,&quot; you croak. &quot;Things are very, very wrong here.&quot;

And with that, you swing your legs to the ground and manage to stand. 

&quot;What do you thi--&quot; she begins.

You stumble out of the nurse&#39;s office into the first floor hallway.

Even the short trip out the door has you gasping for breath, and even as you hear the nurse call for security, you pull out your phone to see a string of missed messages from {$bestFriend}.

Your eyes quickly scroll through the messages, asking about the fight, asking where you are, asking if you&#39;re ok, each with increasing urgency.

It&#39;s time to deal with this.

You push past the wall of faceless when your phone buzzes in your pocket.

~~{$bestFriend}: what is going on? i heard you were in a fight??? wtf?!?~~

You consider putting your phone away but realize you could use a moment to breathe. It&#39;s unlikely that the Other You is planning on leaving the building right now.

Afraid of giving the Other You too much of a lead, you put your phone back into your pocket, ignoring the buzz of another notification, and head downstairs.

You need to put a stop to this, once and for all...

You stand in the mostly empty 1st floor hallway, no sign of the Other You. Remarkably, aside from the few students who don&#39;t ever seem to go to class, the halls are quiet.

[if $injured]
You dig around your backpack with one hand, which you realize is a lot harder than you would have thought. Your hand curls around your water bottle, and flipping the top, take deep gulps of lukewarm water. 

You&#39;ve never tasted better.

[if $hasVeins]
You drop to one knee, unzipping your backpack. As you do, your eyes fall on your black veined hand. They seem to have gotten larger, and the skin around also have darkened into an unhealthy rot. You shudder, pulling that arm away and using your good arm to grab a water bottle.

Flipping the top, you take deep gulps of lukewarm water. You&#39;ve never tasted better. 

[if !$injured &amp;&amp; !$hasVeins]
You drop to one knee, unzipping your backpack. You grab your watter bottle, and flipping open the top, you take deep gulps of lukewarm water. You&#39;ve never tasted better.

You breathe a sigh of relief that someone, despite everything that you&#39;ve faced in the last two periods that you&#39;ve remained relatively unscathed. *Two periods?* you wonder to yourself. How has it only been two periods since your world turned upside down?

[continue]
Thirst slaked, you look up and down the hall. You think you heard the Other You&#39;s voice from this hallway, and your eyes fall on the blue Room 109 sign.

It&#39;s {$bestFriend}&#39;s class, you realize with a start.

You take a step closer and look through the window. You see a student&#39;s back, his dark brown hair. *Johnny,* you think.

And then, as if hearing your thoughts, Johnny spins and the faceless grin he gives you knocks you backward.

Panicked, you step back up to the door, trying to see in but the way the classroom is set up, you can&#39;t see anything but Johnny&#39;s unflinching mouthless grin.

You begin pounding on the door.

No one laughs, and even in the midst of your stress, you manage to roll your eyes. &quot;Really, Mr. Moon?&quot; you whisper under your breath.

The student formerly known as Johnny continues to stand preternaturally still, staring at you as Mr. Moon stalks over the door, swinging it open.

&quot;Now I&#39;m seeing things,&quot; you hear Mr. Moon mutter to himself. &quot;This is really the last thing I need.&quot;

A shiver courses over your body.

&quot;Wait, Mr. Moon,&quot; you begin. &quot;You see that, don&#39;t you?&quot;

Any answer is cut off when you hear {$bestFriend}&#39;s voice. &quot;{$yourName}? Is that you?&quot;

The same black veins cover the windows, growing downward like a fungal infection, all the surfaces pulsing.

Oily pus begin dropping from the lights even as the veins snake their way in through the open windows and begin spreading across the floor.

You watch in horror as one drop lands on the forehead of a student and it immediately spreads, filling their veins with inky blood, moving toward the face where it seems to eat away from the brown face and the delicate features from the inside. She turns to you, faceless.

Another student yells out in fear as a tendril wraps around his ankle, and even as he tries to stomp it with his free foot, another black vein whips around his torso, causing him to topple over. You watch as two separate veins rise up like cobras before plunging into his nostrils.

His scream is cut short as his mouth disappears, along with the rest of his face.

These scenes are repeated all around the room, drops of inky pus and veins of fungal growth claiming one victim after another.

After each is claimed, though, they stand calmly, faceless, and turn toward the two of You.

And you pivot right and body slam You from Your unprotected side.

You flies backward, slamming into the window, a large red-tinged crack appearing in the black-webbed windows. You grunts, shakes Your head, and turns Your eyes on you with venom.

And then it fuzzes again and seems to liquefy. You watch in horror as your... *Your* features melt off Your face and standing in front of you another faceless student, still the same height and build, still wearing your clothes, still with your hair, a faceless mannequin.

{$bestFriend} lays a hand on your shoulder and nods toward the door.

You lead her outside through Door 7, and as the bell rings, you both step out of the double doors to bright blue skies. 

You immediately notice how quiet it is, faceless students pouring out of the doors, but not making noises. You watch in horror as the students climb into waiting cars, congregate at the bus stop, head to practice...

And at your side. &quot;{$bestFriend},&quot; you almost whimper. She turns her blank face toward you as she&#39;s always done, and despite yourself, you shudder. And you swear, an expression of hurt crosses her face. Somehow. &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; you say, letting out a sigh.

Taking one last look back, you see another faceless student watching you through Door 7. You&#39;re pretty sure it was you.

Expecting a trick, You spins around looking for the trap, and you take that moment to knock You to the ground with a well-aimed kick.

You falls, and scrambles around to stare up at you.

&quot;I am done with you. You are not me,&quot; you spit, every word a verbal punch.

{$bestFriend} steps up next to you. &quot;You&#39;re not {$yourName}.&quot;

The Other You&#39;s face fuzzes for a moment before it returns to sharp clarity as that face you look at every morning splits into a maddening grin.

And in the next moment, You leaps to Your feet and that grin born in the darkest nightmares draws closer to you and plants a kiss on your lips.

You convulse before pushing You away. You steps away, grinning, revealing missing teeth and a mass of writhing tendrils in place of a tongue.

&quot;Come on,&quot; {$bestFriend} says, yanking on your arm. &quot;We need to get out of here!&quot;

You run out of the building, nearly tripping on the uneven sidewalk. As you recover, you glance back and see You watching you through Door 7, waving cheerfully.

&quot;Come on,&quot; {$bestFriend} repeats, urging you away.

Your world seems to shatter in that moment that no amount of tendril caused vertigo could even begin to compete with.

&quot;Go.&quot; The note of command is unmistakable.

You falter, sure that that would have worked. You steps forward and before you can react, enfolds you in Your arms. The embrace is ice and oil.

You puts Your mouth to your ear and whispers, &quot;Don&#39;t resist.&quot;

You feel a terrible tugging sensation at your face, and your perspective seems to shift as your eyes seem to worm downward toward your chin.

Shrugging, the body shuffles out of the door as the final bell rings.

You responds with a condescending smile as Your eyes, which had never left yours, turn to the ground around you.

It&#39;s too late to take a step back as three black oily tendrils as thick as your wrists rise up and slither into your eyes and mouth. You feel another tendril gently push you on your chest, and you absently note amidst the searing pain that at least your fall is cushioned.

I hope you enjoyed this story - my first interaction fiction (and to be honest, my first longish piece of writing in a long time).

Special thanks to my beta writers ABCDEFGH

Shoutout to Johnny C from 8th period, who volunteered and won the &quot;guess the number&quot; to be featured in some of the scenes.

And a special shoutout to the inaugural class of Moondalorians, class of 2023, for whom this final project was created!
